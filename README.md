### Hellooooooo ðŸ‘‹

My name is AndrÃ© and I am a studying **Full Stack Web Development** at **Driven Education**. I come from a Mechanical Engineering graduation and i'm currently working in this area, but, from the experience i'm having with Driven, i'm looking forward to entering and developing myself in the tech market. I don't know why but everytime i think about <img alt="Node.js" width="16px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/nodejs/nodejs.png" /> I get euphoric. I think it'll be my first focus in the area.

I belong to the 6th bootcamp class where all the previus classes had outstanding results. By now, we went through 12 weeks of learning, in which we got to face multiple projects in the first module of front-end applications, which contained parts of **<img alt="HTML5" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/html/html.png" />, <img alt="CSS3" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/css/css.png" /> and <img alt="JavaScript" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/javascript/javascript.png" />.**
We got also through the second module, where we got to improve our front-end applications by learning and putting <img alt="React" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/react/react.png" /> into action with some more projects that may be seen below.

Although the front-end modules were very exciting, the more we get into back-end content, the more excited I get.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about nutrition and bodybuilding.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently learning so many things that i couldn't choose some to put here.
