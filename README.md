### Hellooooooo ðŸ‘‹

My name is AndrÃ© and I am a studying **Full Stack Web Development** at **Driven Education**. I come from a Mechanical Engineering graduation and i'm currently working in this area, but, from the experience i'm having with Driven, i'm looking forward to entering and developing myself in the tech market. I don't know why but everytime i think about <img alt="Node.js" width="16px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/nodejs/nodejs.png" /> I get euphoric. I think it'll be my first focus in the area.

I belong to the 6th bootcamp class where all the previus classes had outstanding results. By now, we went through 32 weeks of learning, in which we got to face multiple projects of front-end, back-end and fullstack applications, which contained parts of **<img alt="HTML5" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/html/html.png" />, <img alt="CSS3" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/css/css.png" /> and <img alt="JavaScript" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/javascript/javascript.png" />.**
Now that it's almost in the end of the bootcamp journey, i had so many great impressions over the frameworks and technologies we've studied and a lot of effort put on the process.

Although the front-end modules were very exciting, the more we got into back-end content, the more excited I got throughout this experience.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'd gone through so much learning and working this year that it seems like it's been three years since i got to Driven.
